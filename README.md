Bill Splitter
=============
A straightforward shared expense manager designed for Django, particularly handy for roommates seeking an equitable way to divide their costs. This tool features a simplified model and notably does not include provisions for individuals who join the group at a later time.

How it works
------------

Four friends share a living space and track their expenses using Bill Splitter. At any given time, they can easily check the individual contributions of each member. If User1 has spent less on shared expenses, they can take responsibility for covering the next few bills to ensure fairness among all users.
